Christmas Hack Decorations

This is based off my other repository MakeMeSenpai/Christmas_hack, in which I was attempting to use python3 and learn what I 
could about this project before buying the hardware. But After buying the hardware I had decided it best to code in C++.
In this project we hacked classic holiday lights to flash to music. This is the basic code for this and can be changed to
display different patterns pretty easily.

And Have a great day!
